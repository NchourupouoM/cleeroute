# Question: "The system attempted to add a new section titled "Attention mecanism in the transformer architecture" with the description "mastering the understanding how the transformer architecture work" as the last section in the course. However, the action failed because the provided value was not a valid section dictionary. The course structure remains unchanged.

# Question: on the project in section one in this course, mention the mathematic skills as another prerequisites

# Question: In the last section, add another subsection for modele deployment after evaluation and reporting
# Question: In the introduction of the course mention the mathematics as another skills that will be learn by the learner

# Question: In the session Neural Network Basics, add softmax as another activation fonction to the activation fonction subsection

# sessio for testing
